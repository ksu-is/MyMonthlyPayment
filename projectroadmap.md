+ - [x] Find a repository similar to my idea for MyMonthlyPayment

+ - [x] Break down the parts needed for the app and find a repository that could be potentially useful in the app

+ - [x] Identify Findings:
        I found a repository that fills HTML login information automatically. This would become useful from the first use of the app. The form in the app requires a url, username, and password from the user. This would be an essential component in MyMonthlyPayment to be able to login to any website that the user goes to, to look and pay their monthly bill. After reading through the code and running it, I didn't notice any issues.
